## How It Works

### Adding Employees
Users can add employees by filling out the form with details like Employee ID, Name, Department, Salary, and Performance Review. Once submitted, the employee data appears in the table and is saved to `localStorage` for future access.

### Promoting Employees
The **Promote** option allows users to update an employee's salary by entering a new amount. Updated salaries are immediately reflected in the system and saved to `localStorage`.

### Removing Employees
Clicking **Remove** deletes an employee's record after confirmation. Once removed, the data updates in real-time, ensuring the system stays current.

### Searching Employees
A search bar enables users to locate employees by ID, name, or department. The employee list dynamically adjusts to show only matching results, simplifying record filtering.

### Department Summary
The department summary section automatically calculates the total number of employees and total salary per department, providing an organized view of department data.
